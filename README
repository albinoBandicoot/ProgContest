Some useful code to have pre-prepared for programming contests.

Things to add:
- template for reading input
- Gale-Shapley algorithm for stable matching
- weighted interval scheduling?
- matrix multiply?
- Geometry:
	- polygons
	- rectangles
	- 3D stuff? I've never seen it on a contest
- solving systems of linear equations
- solving systems of linear congruences (yes, this showed up once on a contest!)
